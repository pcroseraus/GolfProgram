 * This files gets everything going.  The Spring Context reads from a file in 
 * the classpath.  Classpath is in src/main/resources for the purposes of this 
 * application. You are usually save to place any files you want to include in
 * your application here. When maven creates the Jar file, it will  include this
 * file.
 * The ContactDao is a Data Access Object that will mine the contacts from the 
 * database which is postgresql at this time. Contacts have contact information
 * in the form of mobile, home, and work phones.
 * Contacts also have Scores.  Each score is associated with a Golf Course, a
 * date, and a Score.  TODO: This is assuming how many holes??
 * Finally it instantiates the GolfTool which creates its view. The manipulation
 * of the views size and visibility is here.  
 * 
 * Notice the public static void main method. It takes no arguments, and is 
 * considered the main method.
